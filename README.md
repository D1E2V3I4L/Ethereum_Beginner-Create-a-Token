# Ethereum_Beginner-Create-a-Token

# Project Title

### MyToken is a simple Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity. It implements a basic ERC-20 token functionality with the ability to mint new tokens and burn existing tokens.

## Description

### This project serves as a beginner's guide to creating a custom Ethereum token on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a simple Solidity smart contract that implements basic token functionalities such as minting and burning tokens. Users can deploy this contract on an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network and interact with it to mint new tokens, burn existing tokens, and retrieve token balances.
## Getting Started

### Installing

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

## 1 Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/D1E2V3I4L/Ethereum_Beginner-Create-a-Token.git

## 2 Navigate to the project directory:

cd Ethereum_Beginner-Create-a-Token



### Executing program

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
* Follow these steps to execute the program:

* Deploy the Solidity smart contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network using tools like Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

* Interact with the deployed contract by calling its functions:

* Use the mintTokens function to create new tokens.
* Use the burnTokens function to burn existing tokens.
* Monitor the contract's state variables such as Total_Supply and balance to track token minting, burning, and balances.

* You can also run tests or make modifications to the contract using Ethereum development frameworks like Truffle or Hardhat.
